# Salesforce Lightning Out Integration

***Overview***

This project demonstrates how I used Salesforce Lightning Out to render a Salesforce Screen Flow externally in a standalone web application. The objective was to embed Salesforce functionality—specifically a user onboarding flow—into a custom website without requiring users to log in to Salesforce.

***What I Accomplished***

- Implemented a Lightning Out app that exposed a Salesforce Flow to an external site.
- Built a Node.js application to serve the Lightning Out component and host the embedded flow.
- Resolved key integration challenges, including CORS issues, Guest User access, and component accessibility.
- Enabled external access to Salesforce features, showcasing how Lightning Out can be used for customer-facing portals and public workflows.

***Tech Stack***

- Salesforce Lightning Platform
- Lightning Out
- Apex
- Screen Flows
- Node.js
- Express.js
- HTML/CSS
- OAuth 2.0 / JWT Authentication

***Skills Demonstrated***

- Cross-platform integration between Salesforce and external systems
- Apex and Flow development for dynamic UI experiences
- Troubleshooting deployment issues such as CORS and guest access
- OAuth and JWT-based authentication handling
- Full-stack implementation from Salesforce configuration to external web hosting
